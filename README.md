# common-chart

A repository to host my common chart

## Usage

Based on the bitnami pattern, 

**why maintain this one ?**

If you a running delivery team and you re-use the bitnami common chart as it is,
it comes with an anormous set of features which I am not sure you really want to expose to your end customer
- he might com to you with do you support mongo :) 
- or why do you support REDIS_PASSWORD I thought we deprecated it ;) etc etc ...
So when im running a demo I want to explain simple things and not the wholse system.
