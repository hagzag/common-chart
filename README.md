# common-chart

A repository to host my common chart

## Usage

based on the bitnami pattern, why maintain this one ?
if your a delivery team and you re-use the common chart as it is it comes twith an anormous set of features which I am not sure you really want to expose to your end customer - he might com to you with do you support mongo :) 
of why do you support REDIS_PASSWORD I thought we deprecated it ;) etc etc ...
